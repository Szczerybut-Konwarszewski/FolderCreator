Project title: FolderCreator

Author: Szczerybut Konwarszewski

Description: Simple application which allows user to create empty folders within folder. For now it serves only 5 levels depth hierarchy, but in future it will be possible to set it to desired value (well, to a certain [limited by individual pc specification] degree...). For now, it offers setting number of folders to be created in a single "branch". 

Purpose of the project: Learning how to manipulate files with VB language. Shall you have any suggestions to projects, please feel free to modify the code.
